      "Generated: The caption is expressing a desire to be able to sarcastically respond to insensitive people who make thoughtless comments, such as telling someone to \"get over\" their feelings. The comic strip illustrates this sentiment by depicting a character who is initially hurt by an insensitive comment, but then suddenly and miraculously \"deletes\" their feelings and is able to celebrate and move on, thanks to the comment. The strip is using irony and sarcasm to highlight the absurdity of thinking that someone can simply \"get over\" their emotions, and to mock the idea that insensitive comments can be helpful. The caption is essentially saying \"if only we could respond to insensitive people in this way, by showing them how ridiculous their comments are.\"\n",
