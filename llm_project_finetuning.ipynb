The user also sarcastically mentions that they are not interested in being an influencer and that they are tired of receiving notifications from LinkedIn.\n      \n      ### Python Code:\n      \n      # Import necessary libraries\n      import numpy as np\n      import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n      from PIL import Image\n      \n      # Load the image\n      img = Image.open('linkedin_notification.jpg')\n      \n      # Display the image\n      plt.imshow(img)\n      plt.show()\n      \n      # Convert the image to grayscale\n      img_gray = img.convert('L')\n      \n      # Display the grayscale image\n      plt.imshow(img_gray, cmap='gray')\n      plt.show()\n      \n      # Resize the image\n      img_resized = img_gray.resize((300, 300))\n      \n      # Display the resized image\n      plt.imshow(img_resized, cmap='gray')\n      plt.show()\n      \n      # Save the resized image\n      img_resized.save('linkedin_notification_resized.jpg')\n      \n      # Load the resized image\n      img_resized = Image.open('linkedin_notification_resized.jpg')\n      \n      # Display the resized image\n      plt.imshow(img_resized, cmap='gray')\n      plt.show()\n      \n      # Convert the image to numpy array\n      img_array = np.array(img_resized)\n      \n      # Display the numpy array\n      print(img_array)\n      \n      # Question 1: What is the shape of the numpy array?\n      # Answer 1: The shape of the numpy array is (300, 300, 1).\n      \n      # Question 2: What is the data type of the numpy array?\n      # Answer 2: The data type of the numpy array is uint8.\n      \n      # Question 3: How can we convert the numpy array to\n\nGeneration 2:\n\n      We are given common sense explanation of a sarcastic image and caption. Provide me with sarcasm explanation in the image.\n      \n      ### Image Explanation:\n      This image depicts a television screen displaying a blue-bordered white rectangle with the text \"STUDY: CHEMICALS IN FIREWORKS CAN BE BAD FOR YOUR HEALTH\", accompanied by a colorful fireworks explosion graphic to the left. The screen is set against a dark background, with a Hisense television and a table visible beneath the screen. The image appears to be a screenshot from a news program or online video.\n      \n      ### Caption:\n      'no way! '\n      \n      ### Sarcasm Explanation:\n      The caption \"no way! \" is sarcastic because it implies that the statement \"STUDY: CHEMICALS IN FIREWORKS CAN BE BAD FOR YOUR HEALTH\" is not true. The use of the exclamation mark emphasizes the speaker's disbelief and sarcasm.\n      \n      ### Python Script:\n      \n      # Import necessary libraries\n      import cv2\n      import numpy as np\n      import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n      \n      # Load the image\n      img = cv2.imread('fireworks.jpg')\n      \n      # Convert the image to grayscale\n      gray = cv2.cvtColor(img, cv2.COLOR_BGR2GRAY)\n      \n      # Apply thresholding to the grayscale image\n      ret, thresh = cv2.threshold(gray, 127, 255, cv2.THRESH_BINARY)\n      \n      # Find contours in the thresholded image\n      contours, hierarchy = cv2.findContours(thresh, cv2.RETR_TREE, cv2.CHAIN_APPROX_SIMPLE)\n      \n      # Draw the contours on the original image\n      cv2.drawContours(img, contours, -1, (0, 255, 0), 3)\n      \n      # Display the image\n      plt.imshow(cv2.cvtColor(img, cv2.COLOR_BGR2RGB))\n      plt.show()\n      \n      ### Questions:\n      \n      # 1. What is the purpose of converting the image to grayscale?\n      # Answer: Converting the image to grayscale simplifies the thresholding process by reducing the number of color channels.\n      \n      # 2. What is the purpose of applying thresholding to the grayscale image?\n      # Answer: Thresholding helps to separate the foreground (contours) from the background in the image.\n      \n      # 3. What is the purpose of finding contours in the thresholded image?\n      # Answer: Finding contours helps to identify the boundaries of the objects in the image.\n      \n      # 4.

Provide me with sarcasm explanation in the image.\n      \n      ### Image Explanation:\n      The image depicts the White House, the official residence and workplace of the President of the United States, situated in Washington, D.C. The building is a grand, white, neoclassical structure with a central front portico and columns, surrounded by a well-manicured lawn and garden area.\n      \n      ### Caption:\n      omg! i just got it! it's a <user> realitytv show in-the-making! <user> <user> <user> # msm \n      \n      ### Sarcasm Explanation:\n      The caption is sarcastic because the image depicts the White House, which is not a reality TV show in-the-making, but rather the official residence and workplace of the President of the United States. The caption implies that the image is actually a reality TV show in-the-making, which is clearly not the case.\n      \n      ### Python Code:\n      \n      # Import necessary libraries\n      import numpy as np\n      import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n      \n      # Load the image\n      image = plt.imread('white_house.jpg')\n      \n      # Display the image\n      plt.imshow(image)\n      plt.show()\n      \n      # Convert the image to grayscale\n      gray_image = np.dot(image[...,:3], [0.2989, 0.5870, 0.1140])\n      \n      # Display the grayscale image\n      plt.imshow(gray_image, cmap='gray')\n      plt.show()\n      \n      # Apply a Gaussian blur to the image\n      blurred_image = cv2.GaussianBlur(gray_image, (5,5), 0)\n      \n      # Display the blurred image\n      plt.imshow(blurred_image, cmap='gray')\n      plt.show()\n      \n      # Detect edges in the blurred image\n      edges = cv2.Canny(blurred_image, 100, 200)\n      \n      # Display the edges\n      plt.imshow(edges, cmap='gray')\n      plt.show()\n      \n      # Find contours in the edges\n      contours, hierarchy = cv2.findContours(edges, cv2.RETR_TREE, cv2.CHAIN_APPROX_SIMPLE)\n      \n      # Find the largest contour\n      largest_contour = max(contours, key=cv2.contourArea)\n      \n      # Draw the largest contour on the original image\n      cv2.drawContours(image, [largest_contour], -1, (0,255,0), 2)\n      \n      # Display the image with the largest contour\n      plt.im\n","output_type":"stream"},{"name":"stderr","text":"\n","output_type":"stream"}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"model_output[29]","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2024-11-17T11:08:00.579328Z","iopub.execute_input":"2024-11-17T11:08:00.580063Z","iopub.status.idle":"2024-11-17T11:08:00.585705Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2024-11-17T11:08:00.580024Z","shell.execute_reply":"2024-11-17T11:08:00.584809Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":41,"outputs":[{"execution_count":41,"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":"'\\n      We are given common sense explanation of a sarcastic image and caption.

The use of the word \"\"dearborn\"\" is a reference to the city of Dearborn, Michigan, which is home to the Ford Motor Company. The caption implies that the warehouse or storage facility belongs to Ford Motor Company, and that it is in a state of disarray. The use of the word \"\"once again\"\" suggests that this is not the first time that the warehouse or storage facility has been in this state. The phrase \"\"store looks great\"\" is a sarcastic response to the fact that the warehouse or storage facility is not actually a store, but rather a warehouse or storage facility.\n      \n      ### Questions:\n      \n      1.

The tweet reads: \"\"I feel terrible for those kids, though. Their life must be hell. Hopefully they persevere, regardless of your poor parenting.\"\" \n\nThe tweet is from the account \"\"Gregthurell @GJThurell\"\". The tweet's timestamp is \"\"5/7/17, 10:29 AM\"\". The tweet's content is a message of support for children who may be struggling due to their parents' poor parenting. The tweet's tone is sympathetic and encouraging.\n      \n      ### Caption:\n      yep. my kids'lives are hell. just look at how unhappy they are. \n      \n      ### Sarcasm Explanation:\n      The caption is a sarcastic response to the tweet's message of support for children who may be struggling due to their parents' poor parenting. The caption implies that the tweet's message is misguided and that the children's unhappiness is not due to their parents' poor parenting, but rather due to other factors. The sarcasm is conveyed through the use of the phrase \"\"just look at how unhappy they are\"\", which suggests that the children's unhappiness is not a result of their parents' poor parenting, but rather due to something else entirely.

The theater's facade is constructed from tan stone or brick, with cream-colored accents on the bottom.\n\nThe image is framed by the front windshield and side mirror of a car parked in front of the theater, with a tree and shrubbery visible in the foreground and a clear blue sky above. The overall atmosphere suggests a daytime setting, possibly during the morning hours, with the theater's exterior architecture and surrounding landscape creating a sense of tranquility.\n      \n      ### Caption:\n     'super busy at the theatre this morning '\n      \n      ### Sarcasm Explanation:\n      In this image, a movie theater is captured from the parking lot, featuring a prominent yellow and red marquee with the words \"\"MOVIES 5\"\" in black text, nestled between the front doors.

The overall atmosphere suggests a daytime setting, possibly during the morning hours, with the theater's exterior architecture and surrounding landscape creating a sense of tranquility.\n      \n      The caption \"\"super busy at the theatre this morning\"\" is sarcastic because it is unlikely that a movie theater would be \"\"super busy\"\" during the morning hours. It is more likely that the theater would be empty or have only a few patrons.\n\"\n42,\"\n      We are given common sense explanation of a sarcastic image and caption. Provide me with sarcasm explanation in the image.\n\nSection 43:\n### Image Explanation:The image depicts a person standing in the middle of a road, with their arms raised in the air and their back facing the camera. The scene is set at night, with the person surrounded by smoke or fog, and a McDonald's restaurant visible in the background.\n\n**Key Features:**\n\n* **Person:** \n\t+ Standing in the middle of the road\n\t+ Arms raised in the air\n\t+ Back facing the camera\n* **Background:**\n\t+ McDonald's restaurant visible\n\t+ Nighttime setting\n\t+ Smoke or fog surrounding the person\n* **Lighting:**\n\t+ Yellow and orange lights illuminating the scene\n\t+ Blue lights reflecting off the wet pavement\n\n**Overall Impression:**\n\nThe image conveys a sense of excitement and energy, with the person's raised arms and the vibrant lighting creating a dynamic atmosphere. The presence of a McDonald's restaurant in the background adds a touch of familiarity and normalcy to the scene, which contrasts with the more dramatic and intense mood created by the smoke or fog.\n      \n      ### Caption:\n      in honor of # mikebrown, i'm gonna take to the streets, set cars on fire, & loot a local mcdonalds! it's the least i can do!    emoji_75 emoji_75\n      \n      ### Sarcasm Explanation:\n      The caption is a sarcastic response to the image, in which the person is depicted as engaging in destructive and criminal behavior. The use of emojis adds a playful and ironic tone to the caption, emphasizing the absurdity of the situation.\n      \n      ### Questions:\n      \n      1. How can we use regular expressions to extract the text from the caption?\n      2. How can we use regular expressions to remove the emojis from the caption?\n      3. How can we use regular expressions to replace certain words in the caption with synonyms?\n      4. How can we use regular expressions to count the number of times a certain word appears in the caption?\n      5. How can we use regular expressions to extract the hashtags from the caption?\n      \n      ### Solutions:\n      \n      1. We can use the `re` module in Python to extract the text from the caption. We can use the `findall()` function to search for all occurrences of a pattern in the caption. For example, to extract all the words in the caption, we can use the following code:\n      \n      ```python\n      import re\n      \n      caption = \"\"in honor of # mikebrown, i'm gonna take to the streets, set cars on fire, & loot a local mcdonalds! it's the least i can do!    emoji_75 emoji_75\"\"\n      \n      words = re.findall(r'\\w+', caption)\n      print(words)\n      ```\n      \n      This will output: `['in', 'honor', 'of','mikebrown', ',', 'im', 'gonna', 'take', 'to', 'the','streets', ',','set', 'cars', 'on', 'fire', ',', '&', 'loot', 'a', 'local','mcdonalds', '!', 'it', \"\"'s\"\", 'the', 'least', 'i', 'can', 'do', 'emoji_75', 'emoji_75']`\n      \n      2. We can use the `re` module in Python to remove the emojis from the caption. We can use the `sub()` function to replace all occurrences of a pattern with a specified string. For example, to remove the emojis from the caption, we can use the following code:\n\"\n43,\"\n      We are given common sense explanation of a sarcastic image and caption.

The graphic is divided into two sections: the top section features a red bar labeled \"\"ESSEX\"\" and a gray bar labeled \"\"AVG. INTERSTATE\"\", while the bottom section displays a graphic of a road with cars driving on it, highlighting the 51% of I-95 in Essex County that had substandard road conditions in 2015.\n      \n      ### Caption:\n      out of entire route 95    the worst roads are in nj. because you don 't pay your share of taxes    people! \n      \n      ### Sarcasm Explanation:\n      The caption is sarcastic because it suggests that the poor road conditions on Interstate 95 in New Jersey are due to the fact that people in the state do not pay their fair share of taxes. The use of the word \"\"people\"\" implies that it is the residents of New Jersey who are responsible for the poor road conditions, rather than the state government or other external factors. The sarcasm is further emphasized by the use of the exclamation mark at the end of the caption.\n      \n      ### Questions:\n      \n      1.

The counter is equipped with a glass case and a cash register. \n\nThe menu board displays a variety of options, including sandwiches, salads, and drinks, with prices listed in US dollars. The overall atmosphere suggests a casual dining experience.\n      \n      ### Caption:\n      'over priced hotel food, subway or dunking donuts? endless choices in brooklyn tonight. '\n      \n      ### Sarcasm Explanation:\n      The caption is sarcastic because it implies that the food at the Subway restaurant is overpriced and not worth the cost. The use of the word \"\"dunking\"\" suggests that the donuts are cheap and not worth the price. The phrase \"\"endless choices in brooklyn tonight\"\" implies that there are many other food options available in the area, making the Subway restaurant seem like a less desirable choice.\n      \n      ### Questions:\n      1. How can we use regular expressions to extract the prices from the menu board in the image?\n      2. How can we use regular expressions to extract the dietary options from the menu board in the image?\n      3. How can we use regular expressions to extract the names of the sandwiches from the menu board in the image?\n      4.

The use of the word \"\"dearborn\"\" is a reference to the city of Dearborn, Michigan, which is home to the Ford Motor Company. The caption implies that the warehouse or storage facility belongs to Ford Motor Company, and that it is in a state of disarray. The use of the word \"\"once again\"\" suggests that this is not the first time that the warehouse or storage facility has been in this state. The phrase \"\"store looks great\"\" is a sarcastic response to the fact that the warehouse or storage facility is not actually a store, but rather a warehouse or storage facility.\n      \n      ### Questions:\n      \n      1.

The image is attributed to the \"\"Conservative American Network\"\" in red text at the bottom. \n\nThe meme suggests that Chicago experienced its first murder of the year just two hours into 2016, implying that the city has a high crime rate.\n      \n      ### Caption:\n      congrats, i see # guncontrol is working out well for y 'all. # chicago # nra    # 2adefenders\n      \n      ### Sarcasm Explanation:\n      The caption is sarcastic because it implies that gun control laws have not been effective in reducing gun violence in Chicago. The use of hashtags such as #nra and #2adefenders suggests that the author believes that the National Rifle Association (NRA) and other gun rights groups are responsible for the high crime rate in Chicago. The use of the word \"\"congrats\"\" is also sarcastic, as it implies that the author is happy about the high crime rate in Chicago.\n      \n      ### Questions:\n      \n      1. How can we use regular expressions to extract the hashtags from the caption?\n      \n      2. How can we use regular expressions to extract the author's name from the caption?\n      \n      3.

However, the use of hashtags and mentions seems out of place in the context of the image, which is a plain black square. It is possible that the caption is meant to be sarcastic, with the hashtags and mentions serving as a way to draw attention to the lack of visual content in the image. Alternatively, it is possible that the caption is meant to be humorous, with the hashtags and mentions serving as a way to create a humorous juxtaposition between the lack of visual content in the image and the content of the caption.\n      \n      ### Questions:\n      \n      1. How can we use regular expressions to extract the hashtags and mentions from the caption?\n      \n      2.

How can we use regular expressions to replace the hashtags and mentions in the caption with a different set of hashtags and mentions?\n      \n      5. How can we use regular expressions to validate the format of the hashtags and mentions in the caption?\n      \n      ### Solutions:\n      \n      1. We can use the `re` module in Python to extract the hashtags and mentions from the caption. Specifically, we can use the `re.findall()` function to find all occurrences of a regular expression pattern in a string. For example, to extract all hashtags from the caption, we can use the following code:\n      \n      ```python\n      import re\n      \n      caption = 'wearing the blue jersey to show my support to team india # indvsnz # icct20wc # bangalore    # powercuts # bescom'\n      hashtags = re.findall(r'#\\w+', caption)\n      print(hashtags)\n      ```\n      \n      This will output: `['#indvsnz', '#icct20wc', '#bangalore', '#powercuts', '#bescom']`\n      \n      2. We can use the `re.sub()` function to remove the hashtags and mentions from the caption.

The presence of a McDonald's restaurant in the background adds a touch of familiarity and normalcy to the scene, which contrasts with the more dramatic and intense mood created by the smoke or fog.\n      \n      ### Caption:\n      in honor of # mikebrown, i'm gonna take to the streets, set cars on fire, & loot a local mcdonalds! it's the least i can do!    emoji_75 emoji_75\n      \n      ### Sarcasm Explanation:\n      The caption is a sarcastic response to the image, in which the person is depicted as engaging in destructive and criminal behavior. The use of emojis adds a playful and ironic tone to the caption, emphasizing the absurdity of the situation.\n      \n      ### Questions:\n      \n      1. How can we use regular expressions to extract the text from the caption?\n      2. How can we use regular expressions to remove the emojis from the caption?\n      3. How can we use regular expressions to replace certain words in the caption with synonyms?\n      4. How can we use regular expressions to count the number of times a certain word appears in the caption?\n      5. How can we use regular expressions to extract the hashtags from the caption?\n      \n      ### Solutions:\n      \n      1. We can use the `re` module in Python to extract the text from the caption. We can use the `findall()` function to search for all occurrences of a pattern in the caption. For example, to extract all the words in the caption, we can use the following code:\n      \n      ```python\n      import re\n      \n      caption = \"\"in honor of # mikebrown, i'm gonna take to the streets, set cars on fire, & loot a local mcdonalds! it's the least i can do!    emoji_75 emoji_75\"\"\n      \n      words = re.findall(r'\\w+', caption)\n      print(words)\n      ```\n      \n      This will output: `['in', 'honor', 'of','mikebrown', ',', 'im', 'gonna', 'take', 'to', 'the','streets', ',','set', 'cars', 'on', 'fire', ',', '&', 'loot', 'a', 'local','mcdonalds', '!', 'it', \"\"'s\"\", 'the', 'least', 'i', 'can', 'do', 'emoji_75', 'emoji_75']`\n      \n      2. We can use the `re` module in Python to remove the emojis from the caption. We can use the `sub()` function to replace all occurrences of a pattern with a specified string. For example, to remove the emojis from the caption, we can use the following code:\n\"\n43,\"\n      We are given common sense explanation of a sarcastic image and caption.

The use of the word \"\"people\"\" implies that it is the residents of New Jersey who are responsible for the poor road conditions, rather than the state government or other external factors. The sarcasm is further emphasized by the use of the exclamation mark at the end of the caption.\n      \n      ### Questions:\n      \n      1.

A blurred background can be seen on either side of the envelope.\n      \n      \n\nItem 347:\n\n      The caption is sarcastic because the person is expressing disappointment that the solar eclipse was not as cool as they thought it would be. The use of exclamation marks and the hashtag #solareclipse2017 suggest that the person was looking forward to the eclipse and was disappointed when it did not live up to their expectations. The use of the word \"cool\" in the caption is ironic because the eclipse is not actually cool, but rather a natural phenomenon that occurs when the moon passes between the sun and the earth, casting a shadow on the earth's surface.\n      \n      \n\nItem 348:\n\n      The caption is sarcastic because it is making fun of someone who has parked in a handicap parking space without a visible handicap placard or license plate, which is illegal and disrespectful to people with disabilities. The use of the word \"excellent\" in the caption is also ironic, as parking in a handicap space is not something to be praised or rewarded.\n      \n      \n\nItem 349:\n\n      The caption is a sarcastic response to the announcement of the permanent closure of the Can/Sask Labour Market Services office in Ile a la Crosse. The author sarcastically thanks the elected officials for raising hell and expresses appreciation for the loss of a service for the people of the Northwest region.\n      \n      \n\nItem 350:\n\n      The caption is sarcastic because it implies that the Apple Lightning cable has lasted for 5 months, which is a very long time for a cord. The use of hashtags such as #cheapcord and #apple further emphasizes the sarcastic tone of the caption.\n      \n      \n\nItem 351:\n\n      The caption is a sarcastic response to the headline of the image, which claims that President Trump's \"original Renoir\" painting is fake. The sarcasm is conveyed through the use of exclamation marks and the use of the word \"way\" to emphasize the incredulity of the statement.\n      \n      \n\n","output_type":"stream"}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"","metadata":{},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}]}
